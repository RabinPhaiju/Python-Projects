1.  Tuple -> Immutable
    - Elements in a tuple cannot be edited once assigned.
    - a tuple cannot be appended to or extended in anyway.
    - tuples are indexed similar to list.
    - define empty tuple
      - a = tuple()
    - define tuple
      - a = 1,2,3,4,5
      - b = 4,
      - c = (0, 1, 2, 3)
      - d = (4,) => tuple type
      - d = (4) => int type
    - 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
    - # but they can contain mutable objects:
    - v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
      - x, y = v
2.  a = (1)

- type of a is int
- bracket in python is optional
