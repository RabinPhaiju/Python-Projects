1. Create a class named 'Circle' with an attribute 'radius' and two methods that
returns area and perimeter of the circle respectively.

2. Create a class name 'Vehicle' with attributes 'name', 'speed' and 'manufacturer'
and a method to get the speed. Further extend this class into two other classes named 'Car'
and 'Plane' with car having attributes 'horsepower' for 'Car' and 'engines' for 'Plane'.
Use constructors to initialize the initial values.

3. Write a class with that has an attribute which stores a multi word string,
 and a method that gives that string in reverse order word-by-word
e.g. 'This is a test'
output: 'test a is This'
