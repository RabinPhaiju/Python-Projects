# The Zen of Python

    - Beautiful is better than ugly.
    - Explicit is better than implicit.
    - Simple is better than complex.
    - Complex is better than complicated.
    - Flat is better than nested.
    - Sparse is better than dense.
    - Readability counts.
    - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    - Although practicality beats purity.
    - Erros should never pass silently.
    - Unless explicit silenced.
    - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    - Now is better than never.
    - Although never is often better than *right* now.
    - If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea.
    - IF the implementation is easy to explain, it may be good idea.
